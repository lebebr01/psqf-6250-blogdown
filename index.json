A first common step to explore our research question is to plot the data. To do this we are going to use the R package, ggplot2, which was installed when running the install.packages command above. You can explore the midwest data by calling up the help file as well with ?midwest.\nCreate a ggplot To plot these two variables from the midwest data, we will use the function ggplot and geom_point to add a layer of points. We will treat popdensity as the x variable and percollege as the y variable.\nggplot(data = midwest) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege)) Examples Try plotting popdensity by state. Try plotting county by state. Does this plot work? Bonus: Try just using the ggplot(data = midwest) from above. What do you get? Does this make sense?  Note: You should be able to modify the structure of the code above to do this.\n  Add Aesthetics Aesthetics are a way to explore more complex interactions within the data. Particularly, from the above example, lets add in the state variable to the plot via an aesthetic.\nggplot(data = midwest) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) As you can see, we simply colored the points by the state they belong in. Does there appear to be a trend?\nExamples Using the same aesthetic structure as above, instead of using colors, make the shape of the points different for each state. Instead of color, use alpha instead. What does this do to the plot?    Global Aesthetics Above, we specified a variable to an aesthetic, which is a common use of aesthetics. However, the aesthetics can also be assigned globally. Here are two examples using the first scatterplot created.\nggplot(data = midwest) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege), color = \u0026#39;pink\u0026#39;) ggplot(data = midwest) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege), shape = 15) These two plots changed the aesthetics for all of the points. Notice, the suttle difference between the code for these plots and that for the plot above. The placement of the aesthetic is crucial, if it is within the parentheses for aes() then it should be assigned a variable. If it is outside, as in the last two examples, it will define the aesthetic for all the data.\nExamples Try the following command: colors(). This will print a vector of all the color names within R, try a few to find your favorites. What happens if you use the following code:  ggplot(data = midwest) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;)) What is the problem?\n  Facets Instead of defining an aesthetic to change the color or shape of points by a third variable, we can also plot each groups data in a single plot and combine them. The process is easy with ggplot2 by using facets.\nggplot(data = midwest) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege)) + facet_grid(. ~ state) You can also use facet_wrap.\nggplot(data = midwest) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege)) + facet_wrap(~ state) Examples Can you facet with a continuous variable? Try it!    Geoms ggplot2 uses a grammar of graphics which makes it easy to switch different plot types (called geoms) once you are comfortable with the basic syntax. For example, how does the following plot differ from the scatterplot first generated above? What is similar?\nggplot(data = midwest) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege)) We can also do this plot by states\nggplot(data = midwest) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, linetype = state), se = FALSE) What about the code above gave me the different lines for each state? Note, I also removed the standard error shading from the plot as well.\nExamples It is possible to combine geoms, which we will do next, but try it first. Try to recreate this plot.     Combining multiple geoms Combining more than one geom into a single plot is relatively straightforward, but a few considerations are important. Essentially to do the task, we just simply need to combine the two geoms we have used:\nggplot(data = midwest) + geom_point(aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state), se = FALSE) A couple points about combining geoms, first, the order matters. In the above example, we called geom_point first, then geom_smooth. When plotting these data, the points will then be plotted first followed by the lines. Try flipping the order of the two geoms to see how the plot differs.\nWe can also simplify this code to not duplicate typing:\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) Examples Can you recreate the following figure?     Other geom examples There are many other geoms available to use. To see them all, visit http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html which gives examples of all the possibilities. This is a handy resource that I keep going back to.\nGeoms for single variables The introduction to plotting has been with two variables, but lets take a step back and focus on one variable with a bar chart.\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = state)) + geom_bar() You can also easily add aesthetics this base plot as shown before.\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = state)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(inmetro))) A few additions can help interpretation of this plot:\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = state)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(inmetro)), position = \u0026#39;fill\u0026#39;) ggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = state)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(inmetro)), position = \u0026#39;dodge\u0026#39;) It is also possible to do a histrogram of a quantitative variable:\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity)) + geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. You can adjust the binwidth directly:\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000)  Examples With more than two groups, histograms are difficult to interpret due to overlap. Instead, use the geom_density to create a density plot for popdensity for each state. The final plot should look similar to this:  Using geom_boxplot, create boxplots with popdensity as the y variable and state as the x variable. Bonus: facet this plot by the variable inmetro.     Plot Customization There are many many ways to adjust the look of the plot, I will discuss a few that are common.\nChange axes Axes are something that are commonly altered, particularly to give them a good name and also to alter the values shown on the axes. These are generally done with scale_x_* and scale_y_* where * is a filler based on the type of variable on the axes.\nFor example:\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(\u0026quot;Population Density\u0026quot;) + scale_y_continuous(\u0026quot;Percent College Graduates\u0026quot;) To change the legend title, the scale_color_discrete command can be used to adjust the color aesthetic and the variable is discrete.\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(\u0026quot;Population Density\u0026quot;) + scale_y_continuous(\u0026quot;Percent College Graduates\u0026quot;) + scale_color_discrete(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) we can also alter the breaks showing on the x-axis.\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(\u0026quot;Population Density\u0026quot;, breaks = seq(0, 80000, 20000)) + scale_y_continuous(\u0026quot;Percent College Graduates\u0026quot;) + scale_color_discrete(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;)   Zoom in on plot You’ll notice that there are outliers in this scatterplot due to larger population density values for some counties. It may be of interest to zoom in on the plot. The plot can be zoomed in by using the coord_cartesian command as follows.\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(\u0026quot;Population Density\u0026quot;) + scale_y_continuous(\u0026quot;Percent College Graduates\u0026quot;) + scale_color_discrete(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 15000)) Note: This can also be achieved using the xlim argument to scale_x_continuous above, however this will cause some points to not be plotted. In this case it would not be a huge deal, however, if we plotted the smooth lines from before you can see the difference.\nggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + scale_x_continuous(\u0026quot;Population Density\u0026quot;) + scale_y_continuous(\u0026quot;Percent College Graduates\u0026quot;) + scale_color_discrete(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 15000)) ggplot(data = midwest, mapping = aes(x = popdensity, y = percollege, color = state)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + scale_x_continuous(\u0026quot;Population Density\u0026quot;, limits = c(0, 15000)) + scale_y_continuous(\u0026quot;Percent College Graduates\u0026quot;) + scale_color_discrete(\u0026quot;State\u0026quot;) ## Warning: Removed 16 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth). ## Warning: Removed 16 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

R is an object oriented language, this is much different than many other software languages.\nR works as a calculator R can be used as a calculator to do any type of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (among other things).\n1 + 2 - 3 ## [1] 0 5 * 7 ## [1] 35 2/1 ## [1] 2 sqrt(4) ## [1] 2 2^2 ## [1] 4 Being an object oriented system, values can directly saved within an object to be used later. As an example:\nx \u0026lt;- 1 + 3 x ## [1] 4 This can then be used later in other calculations:\nx * 3 ## [1] 12 This simplistic example is a bit too simple to show all the benefits of this approach, but will become more apparent when we start reading in data and doing more complicated data munging type tasks.\nNaming conventions This is a topic in which you will not get a single answer, but rather a different answer for everyone you ask. I prefer something called snake_case using underscores to separate words in an object. Others use titleCase as a way to distinguish words others yet use period.to.separate words in object names.\nThe most important thing is to be consistent. Pick a convention that works for you and stick with it through out. Avoiding this Mixed.TypeOf_conventions at all costs.\n  R is case sensitive This can cause problems and make debugging a bit more difficult. Be careful with typos and with case. Here is an example:\ncase_sensitive \u0026lt;- 10 Case_sensitive ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object \u0026#39;Case_sensitive\u0026#39; not found  Functions We have already been using functions when working through creating graphics with R. A function consists of at least two parts, the function name and the arguments as follows: function_name(arg1 = num, arg2 = num). The arguments are always inside of parentheses, take on some value, and are always named. To call a function, use the function_name followed by parentheses with the arguments inside the parentheses. For example, using the rnorm function to generate values from a random normal distribution:\nset.seed(1) rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1) ## [1] -0.6264538 0.1836433 -0.8356286 1.5952808 0.3295078 -0.8204684 ## [7] 0.4874291 0.7383247 0.5757814 -0.3053884 Notice I called the arguments by name directly, this is good practice, however, this code will generate the same values (the values are the same because I’m using set.seed here):\nset.seed(1) rnorm(10, 0, 1) ## [1] -0.6264538 0.1836433 -0.8356286 1.5952808 0.3295078 -0.8204684 ## [7] 0.4874291 0.7383247 0.5757814 -0.3053884 The key when arguments are not called via their names is the order of the arguments. Look at ?rnorm to see that the first three arguments are indeed n, mean, and sd. When you name arguments, they can be specified in any order (generally bad practice).\nset.seed(1) rnorm(sd = 1, n = 10, mean = 0) ## [1] -0.6264538 0.1836433 -0.8356286 1.5952808 0.3295078 -0.8204684 ## [7] 0.4874291 0.7383247 0.5757814 -0.3053884 You can save this result to an object to be used later.\nset.seed(1) norm_values \u0026lt;- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1) Notice the result is no longer printed to the screen, but rather is saved to the object norm_values. To see the result, you could just type norm_values in the console.\n Errors Lastly, I want to discuss errors. Errors are going to happen. Even the best programmers encounter errors that they did not anticipate and debugging needs to happen. If you encounter an error I recommend doing the following few things first:\nUse ?function_name to explore the details of the function. The examples at the bottom of every R help page can be especially helpful.\n If this does not help, copy and paste the error and search on the internet. Chances are someone else has had this error and has asked how to fix it. This is how I fix most errors I am unable to figure out with the R help.\n If these two steps still do not help, feel free to email me, but take the time to do steps 1 and 2. If you do email me, please include the following things:\n The error message directly given from R A reproducible example of the code. The reproducible example is one in which I can run the code directly with no modifications. Without this, it is much more difficult if not impossible for me to help without asking for more information.

The source file (the .Rmd) file will be turned in as well as the compiled version (html). The general form of the R code to be included in the document will be given to you. You may be asked to manipulate simple R commands.\nR Markdown Setup Using RStudio, open up a new template for an R Markdown file. To do this, go to File \u0026gt; New File \u0026gt; R Markdown. A new window should open up, type in the details, and ensure that HTML Output is clicked. When finished entering in details, click the ‘okay’ button. Upon hitting the ‘okay’ button, a document template should show up. Read the elements in the template, then once comfortable with its contents, you can delete it and continue to the questions below.   Questions Using Markdown syntax, create a header that says Question 1. Note, you can pick any level of header you wish. Create subsequent headers for each question below. 1 pt\n Create an unordered list that lists your research interests (please list at least 2 interests here). 1 pt\n Create a hyperlink (link to a webpage) that links to the main R project website. Add the link in two ways, one that show the actual link and two, one that has the link embedded within text. You can pick whatever you wish for the link text. 2 pts\n Add a R code chunk to the document. Within this code chunk add the following R code: summary(iris). Ensure to give the chunk a unique name. 2 pts\n Add a line break/horizontal line here now. 1 pt\n Using output from the R command used in the code chunk above, create a table that summarizes the first four variables from the output. 2 pts\n Add a new R code chunk. Inside this code chunk add the following R code: hist(iris$Sepal.Length). Ensure to give the chunk a unique name and also add the chunk option to omit the code from being shown in the output. 2 pts\n Create an ordered list with Markdown that ranks your top vacations you have taken. Within each of your top vacations, add a nested item (e.g. https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/10-nestedLists.html) to each of your vacations that states the top activities you did while on vaction. 2 pts\n Write some text that specifies the correlation between the continuous variables from the iris data. Place the following two bits of code inline in their relavent positions. The two correlations can be calculated with the following bit of code: round(cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width), 2) and round(cor(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width), 2) 2 pts\n Let’s now create another figure with the following R code, plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width). Similar to above, give the chunk a unique name and also add the chunk option to omit the code from being shown in the output. For this figure, explore the knitr chunk options (https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) to add a figure caption to the figure. 2 pts\n Add one last code chunk (ensure this chunk has a unique name). Ensure through chunk options that the code is not evaluated, but the code is returned. 3 pts\n  x \u0026lt;- rnorm(100) y \u0026lt;- runif(100, min = 3, max = 8) mean(x) mean(y)  ","date":1609977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609977600,"objectID":"0125028e0a0739cc5b3cae5982c0f491","permalink":"https://psqf6250.brandonlebeau.org/assignments/assignment/assignment1/","publishdate":"2021-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/assignment/assignment1/","section":"assignments","summary":"Reproducible Rmarkdown Document: 20 pts\nFor this assignment, you will create your first reproducible R Markdown document.
